# joystick-feedback

This tool plays a user configurable sound, when entering and exiting the deadzone of multiple joystick's X,Y,Z axis.
You can also add sounds to joystick buttons.

Also, for Elite Dangerous only, you can execute macro keys after pressing a joystick button. 
This will only work if that joystick button is not already used in the game. 
When there is only a binding to a joystick / controller / mouse for a particular macro function, then you need to add a keyboard binding.
All the configured key bindings from the game are automatically used and also game state feedback is used. 

(This kind of macro functionality is also possible using a streamdeck or voice attack.)

The audible cue is for use with my VKB kosmosima joystick with omni-throttle adapter on a gunfighter base, that has the y-axis spring removed.
This joystick is now used as a throttle with 3 degrees of freedom.

I changed the cams to 'space soft center' and changed to #10 springs.

The red led turns on when the y-axis is in the center (deadzone).

I increased the y-axis deadzone to 5%.

I removed the y-axis spring and tightened the dry clutch.
You will need to tighten the clutch a bit, because otherwise the rubber dust cover will pull back the stick when you let it go. 

By removing the spring, you won't feel the center anymore. 
There is no mechanical center detent.
That's what the LED and increased deadzone is for.

In addition, this tool adds an audible cue, that you have entered or exited the y-axis deadzone.

You don't have to remove the y-axis spring, if you, for example, turn flight assist mode off in Elite Dangerous or use cruise control in star citizen.
But, I like to have more of a conventional throttle feel..

Each (virtual) joystick is configured via a separate .json file in the Data\Joysticks directory.

```
{
  "PID": "0126",
  "VID": "231D",

  "Y": {
    "Deadband": 1500,
    "InDeadzoneSoundFile": "63528__florian-reinke__button-off.wav",
    "OutDeadzoneSoundFile": "beep-3.wav"
  },

  "Buttons": {
    "4": {
      "SoundFile": "63528__florian-reinke__button-off.wav",
      // turn lights on then off again
      "EDActions": [
        "ShipSpotLightToggle-ON",
        "2000",
        "ShipSpotLightToggle-OFF"
      ]
    },
    "5": {
      "SoundFile": "63528__florian-reinke__button-off.wav",
      //trigger discovery scanner bound to secondary fire button on fire group D
      "EDActions": [
        "DeployHardpointToggle-ON",
        "PlayerHUDModeToggle-AM",
        "FireGroup-D",
        "SecondaryFire-DOWN",
        "10000",
        "SecondaryFire-UP",
        "FireGroup-A",
        "PlayerHUDModeToggle-CM",
        "3000"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can also, optionally, add the deadband and sound files for X and Z axes and add sounds to joystick buttons.

This is a useful tool, to find out the joystick VID, PID and button numbers (this tool is not limited to VKB joysticks):

![vkb_joytester](https://i.imgur.com/GqW3RHk.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/GqW3RHk.png)

The deadzone lies between 32767 - Deadband and 32767 + Deadband

The sounds can be changed or disabled by editing the various SoundFile fields

Some example sounds can be found in the Sounds directory.

# Changes to my VKB kosmosima on a gunfighter base

Get VKBDevCfg-C.exe from the vkb site.

https://vkbcontrollers.com/?page_id=4609

There is a manual controller_2_15_En.pdf for the VKBDevCfg-C application.

Edit zconfig.ini and add User=Developer to the [User] section.

Start VKBDevCfg-C and go to Global\External\LEDs and add a new entry for the Axis in center event.

My setup :

![setup1](https://i.imgur.com/K4zZG9U.png)

I increased the y-axis deadband from 0.5% to 5% on the profile\axes\logical axes screen. (You need to uncheck the 2D checkbox)

# Elite Dangerous joystick macro actions

**When using Odyssey, the on-foot binding must be 'custom'. (this will happen automatically once you make at least one on-foot keyboard binding)
If you see a default binding name, then the plugin won't work correctly.**

If nothing happens, when executing macros:

You may see errors like this in the plugin log file :

`file not found C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\Options\Bindings\Custom.4.0.binds`

In that case, the application has no access to the bindings directory. Start the applicationas administrator.

All keyboard bindings in the .bindings file are available :

`%LocalAppData%\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\Options\Bindings\`

If the macro function is a number, then there will be a delay (the unit is milliseconds)

The following macro functions use the game state. 
They should not be executed multiple times in quick succession, because it takes some time for the application to receive the game state change.

| SecondaryFire-DOWN | Secondary Fire Press |

These are regular key bindings. 
You can find more in the .binding file, that can also be used as macro functions.
Not many have been tested.
